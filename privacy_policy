## 1. Collection of personal information

### Data storage model

It's important to understand that **CanvasMind stores your personal data locally on your device**. This means your journal entries, reflections, mood tracking data, and personal settings are primarily stored on your own device and not on our servers, with the exception of data explicitly shared with friends as detailed below.

### Information we collect automatically

When you use the CanvasMind App, we automatically collect certain data, including:

- **Device information**: Your device model, operating system version, network settings, and unique device identifier
- **Usage patterns**: Which features of the App you open and use, which buttons you interact with
- **Time metrics**: Frequency and duration of your activities in the App, when you are active
- **Approximate location**: Country/region level location data (determined by IP address)
- **Error logs**: Data about App crashes or technical issues

This data is collected to help inform and improve our development direction and enhance the overall user experience.

This analytics data is collected automatically and **cannot be disabled**, as it is essential for improving the App experience, fixing bugs, and developing new features.

We work with trusted third-party analytics providers to collect and process this data. This information is anonymized and aggregated, and is used for performance analysis, identifying trends, and improving functionality.

We do not use or share this data with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes, nor do we sell it.

### Information we do NOT collect or access

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We DO NOT have access to:

- Your journal entries or drawings
- Your personal thoughts or reflections
- Your scheduled activities or routines
- The content of your mood tracking entries
- Any mental health data you enter into the App

**Example**: While we may know that you used the journaling feature on a specific date, we do not have access to the actual content of what you wrote.

### Mental Health Data

The App allows you to record moods, associated activities, feelings, and additional notes detailing mental health, moods, or related thoughts (collectively "Mental Health Data"). This information is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers. Mental Health Data constitutes a special category of personal data under many privacy regulations, including the GDPR. 

We do not process this sensitive information on our servers unless you explicitly choose to share an entry with a friend. Even in that case, the data is only used to facilitate the sharing feature and is never analyzed or used for any other purpose.

### Data Sharing and Cloud Storage

Most of your data in CanvasMind is stored locally on your device. However, when you use the friend sharing feature:

1. **Shared Entries**: When you explicitly share a journal entry with a friend, that specific entry's content (including text, emotional data, and images) is securely transmitted to our cloud storage to enable sharing.

2. **Friend Connection Data**: Basic information about your connections with friends, including user IDs and sharing preferences, is stored in our cloud database.

3. **Thumbnails and Images**: When you share entries containing images, these images may be uploaded to our secure cloud storage to facilitate sharing.

We do not analyze, process, or use this shared content for any purpose other than enabling the functionality you requested. Your non-shared journal entries remain exclusively on your device.



### Information you provide directly

If you contact us for support or other inquiries, we collect the information you provide, such as your email address and the content of your communication.

### Financial and subscription information

All purchases made through the App are processed by Apple's App Store or Google Play. CanvasMind does not collect, store, or have access to your payment information, including credit card details.

Purchases made through Apple In-App purchase are subject solely to Apple's terms and conditions and Apple's Privacy Policy.

Purchases made through Google In-App are subject solely to Google Play's Terms of Service and Google's Privacy Policy.

## 2. Use of personal information

### How we use your information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

- To provide and maintain the App functionality
- To improve and optimize the App experience
- To develop new features based on user behavior patterns
- To fix bugs and technical issues
- To analyze the effectiveness of different features
- To enhance user experience
- To ensure technical stability of the App
- To respond to your requests or inquiries

### Legal grounds for processing

We process your data based on the following legal grounds:

- **Contract** - The data we process is necessary to provide you with the App services and features as agreed when you downloaded and started using the App
- **Legitimate Interest** - We process App usage data to develop our service and offer users a more advanced product

## 3. Sharing of personal information

### Third-party service providers

We work with a limited number of third-party service providers for analytics and app development. These service providers help us:

- Analyze anonymous app usage data
- Process aggregated data for product improvement
- Provide technical infrastructure and support

These service providers are contractually obligated to use your information only for the purposes of providing services to us and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### App store providers

When you download or purchase the App through Apple App Store or Google Play Store, these platforms collect information according to their own privacy policies. We recommend reviewing their privacy policies for more information.

### Legal requirements

We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or government agency).

### Business transfers

If CanvasMind is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you via email and/or a prominent notice in our App of any change in ownership.

## 4. Data security and retention

### Data security

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. These measures include:

- Encryption of data in transit
- Pseudonymization where appropriate
- Strict access controls (need-to-know basis)
- Careful selection of service providers with security considerations in mind

Since most of your personal data is stored locally on your device, we also recommend:  

- Using device passcodes/passwords
- Keeping your device operating system and the App updated
- Being cautious about giving physical access to your device to others
- Using the built-in biometric authentication feature for additional protection if available on your device

### Data retention

We are committed to the principle of storage limitation and will retain your personal data for no longer than necessary to fulfill our processing purposes:

- **App usage and analytics data**: Retained for up to 24 months
- **Error logs and diagnostic data**: Stored for up to 180 days
- **Contact data**: Retained for up to 12 months after your last interaction with us or until your request is resolved, whichever is later

Following account deletion, revocation of consent, or a written deletion request, your personal data will be retained for no longer than 30 days, except where legal obligations require longer retention periods.

We may also anonymize some personal data so it will no longer be associated with you. In this event, we are entitled to retain and use the anonymized information without restriction.

Since most of your personal data is stored locally on your device, deleting the App will remove most of your personal information from our ecosystem.

## 5. Your privacy rights

### Your control over your data

You have the following rights regarding your personal information:

- **Right to access**: You can request information about what data we collect about you
- **Right to deletion**: You can request deletion of the data we hold about you
- **Right to correction**: You can request correction of inaccurate data

The simplest way to exercise control over most of your data is to delete the App from your device, as most personal information is stored locally.

### California and EU user rights

If you are a California resident or EU resident, you may have additional rights as detailed in Section 10 of this privacy policy.

## 6. Children's privacy

The App is not intended for individuals under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under age 16. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take necessary actions.

## 7. Analytics and data collection

The App uses analytics tools to collect usage data that helps us improve the App. This analytics data collection is **mandatory** and cannot be disabled, as it provides essential information for improving the App experience, fixing bugs, and developing new features.

This analytics data is anonymized and aggregated before analysis. It contains information about how the App is used but does not include the personal content you create within the App.

## 8. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.

## 10. Supplemental notices for specific jurisdictions

### International Data Transfers

If we need to transfer your personal data to partners or service providers outside your country of residence (such as to the United States), we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your data.

For transfers from the EU/EEA to countries without an adequate level of protection (as determined by the European Commission), we implement appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission or binding corporate rules. We continuously monitor international data protection developments and adjust our data transfer mechanisms accordingly.

### California Privacy Rights

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides you with specific rights regarding your personal information. These include the right to know what personal information we collect, the right to request deletion of your personal information, and the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information. Please note that we do not sell your personal information.

### European Union Privacy Rights

If you are a resident of the European Union or European Economic Area, you have certain rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), including the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data, the right to restrict or object to our processing of your data, and the right to data portability.
